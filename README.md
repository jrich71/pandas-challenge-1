# Module 4 Challenge

## Background

The Module 4 challenge uses Pandas to analyze a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. The assignment provided me exposure to Pandas for examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. The Module's end result is identifying the "Top 5" clients for generating a company's Total Profit ($ Millions).

## Structure

The Module 4 assignment is broken into four parts:

- Part 1: Exploring the Data
- Part 2: Transforming the Data
- Part 3: Confirming the Work
- Part 4: Analyzing and Summarizing

## Solution

It should be noted that the solution(s) were derived with resources that went beyond what the classes covered. In addition to instructor office hours and the Bootcamp's Slack channel, I relied on multiple resources:

- [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/general_functions.html)

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
    
- Xpert Learning Assistant (available via the Bootcamp)
